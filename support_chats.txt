User: Hello looking for support on an unknown charge
Support: yes, tell me what is the charge?
User: It was a charge made June 12th for $7.14
Support: yes, that was a surcharge that you had for one of your shipment. charged by UPS. for tracking number:
User: Corrected From Address Zip Code to 34113
Support: the from address os the sender, the receiver is the to address. where did u drop the package ? in what zip?
User: The sender and receiver address are both right. I dropped this package off at a local ups drop of location in 07083
Support: hold on, i m checking with the UPS system
User: Thank you
Support: Yeah they charged since it’s a different drop off zip code. Regardless if it’s one town over or 50, they charge a fee since they have to take that package to the other facility and relabel it
Support: So that’s why
User: I definitely think that's something you guys should let people know while purchasing the label
Support: We will update that. We almost never get that one since most people drop off in correct zip code
Support: btw here the ups report that i see
Support: Is 7207 apt number?

User: Hi, i need to reconcile my shipments from 5/16-5/17 to find an order, but when i look back it doesn't tell me the name on each shipment or view the label. It just shows address
User: Can you please help me regarding this?
Support: what information do u want to see exactly
User: I want to see the name attached to these shipments or be able to view the labels . I'm trying to work backwards to find a customer
Support: ok, i will update so u can see the receiver name and u can click reprint to show label again
Support: give it around 10 min
Support: and refresh the app
User: Okay thanks. Let me know when it's viewable please
Support: You can reload the app now, you will be able to view the purchase date / receiver name next to address and if u want to see the label, u can click reprint - i hope it will help u, if u need more help, just ping me
User: Thanks
User: Much better

User: Trying to make labels just loaded funds to my account but says pay the pending invoice any way to fix this issue
Support: already fixed
Support: can u try to click buy again
User: Ok cool
Support: and i will make sure it will never happen again
User: Thx

---

User: When I try to buy a label it says shipment creation failed
User: And I got charged
Support: let me see and fix that for u
User: Thank you
Support: it should be good now, u can generate your label.
User: So I will be charged back ?
Support: it will not charge you again. you already have credit

---

User: Charging incorrectly again
Support: let me see
Support: it automatically credit u actually, i think it thought u activated protection. that should be automatically disabled for u.
User: Okay. Every shipment i have to uncheck the protection box
Support: i m deploying now a new version so u don't have to do that anymore and automatically will be off
User: Okay, hopefully the price it's showing will be the price I'm charged moving forward. I think as of now that's my biggest complaint overall, because i would've gotten an ups ground label for this because it was $12.07 through my other platform but decided to do this since it was only $.70 more but ended up being over $1.50 more
Support: it is. i just checked, it added up the protection price and we have applied that ur account never pay protection, so the system automatically credited u. to make sure always good. i pushed that protection is disabled by default in your account. u can check it now actually
User: That's weird. Because i unchecked the protection box. Must've been a glitch. No worries

User: How to get to USPS shipping not ups
Support: we are adding surepost which is cheaper than usps in like 2 hours actually
User: How does that work?
Support: it is ups label that handed to usps for special price. it is cheaper for small package
User: Ohh
User: So if I were to use the UPS label and send it through usps facility what would happen?
Support: nah. they don’t accept it. surepost is a different program that will use ups and usps both to have cheaper price actually. i will put it live and u can check the price
User: Okay cool
User: How do I fix 'cannot read proprietary's of null's
User: Null'?*
Support: let me see ur issue
Support: give me 5 min i m checking it. it seems there is a problem in the address maybe
User: Okay
Support: i just checked the error. are u sure about those dimensions?
User: Not 100% sure
User: But I know it's 3 boxes + 1 no box pair
User: It's my first time making a label by my self lol
User: I normally have someone else make it for me
Support: oh, those dimensions are not correct. if u have multiple boxes, either u put all in 1 big box or ship it separately. because those dimensions are consider to be huge
Support: u are going to ship sneakers?
User: No he is shipping them
User: I'm the receiver
Support: either ask him for dimensions or usually a sneaker box ( 1 pair ) is 14 x 10 x 5
Support: the best way to do it always, to ask for exact dimensions so u don't have under or over pay UPS
User: Okay I'll ask him
Support: the best way always to give the exact dimensions
User: Thanks for the help
Support: yes, no problem. i will be also adding SurePost to your account also. just fyi, SurePost and usps is cheaper in small boxes but UPS is cheaper in bigger boxes
User: Okay cool thanks man
